# WikipediaRoamer
Project Title

This algorithm finds a link path between any two English Wikipedia pages, in the fashion of the Wikipedia Game, found at https://thewikigame.com/

Getting Started

Download and extract all files from the zip file. Compile all Java files and run the WikipediaGameGUI.java file to play the game.

To play the game, compile all files and run the WikipediaGameGUI.java file. This will open up a separate window. You will see the main menu, which will have two buttons. One will take you to a page describing the game and instructing you how to play the game. The other will take you to the page that allows you to pllay the game. To return from the instruction page to the main menu, click the button at the bottom of the page. Once at the game play page, enter the title of the start page and end page into their respective text fields. Example: to find a path from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webkinz to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt, enter Webkinz into the start text field and Theodore Roosevelt into the end text field. Then click the get path button. Don't worry if the program takes a minute and seems to freeze, path generation  is a known running time issue (it takes a bit) but the program still works. Once path generation is complete, this will take you to the result page, which will show the link path from start to end with page titles and page images, should the latter be available. From the result page, you can click the play again button to go back to the game play page and enter new page title terms and generate a new link path.

Prerequisites

You need at least Java 7 and some sort of IDE downloaded, such as DrJava (which was what we used) or Eclipse. You can download Java at https://java.com/en/download/ and you can download DrJava at http://www.drjava.org/
